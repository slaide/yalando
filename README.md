this is yalando. a new and innovative eCommerce platform where the user is precisely served the products he wants, based on his input.

this readme mostly tracks the stuff that still needs to be done/pushed:
- server user only one completely random queue if the query does not contain usefull information, instead of 3 seperate queues based off seperate starting points
- add placeholder description for recommendation view when mouse does not hover above a field
- let background color of recommendation panel blink when user hovers above a new recommendation
- change embedding selection screen
