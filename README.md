this is yalando. a new and innovative eCommerce platform where the user is precisely served the products he wants, based on his input.

this readme mostly tracks the stuff that still needs to be done/pushed:
- serve user only one completely random queue if the query does not contain usefull information, instead of 3 seperate queues based off seperate starting points
- add button to search for shoe id in wishlist, if it contains exactly one shoe
- maybe animate more things
