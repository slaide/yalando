this is yalando. a new and innovative eCommerce platform where the user is precisely served the products he wants, based on his input.

this readme mostly tracks the stuff that still needs to be done/pushed:
- server user only one completely random queue if the query does not contain usefull information, instead of 3 seperate queues based off seperate starting points
- enable search for a specific shoe id
- add shoe id under bullet points in shoe detail panel, and start a new search based off that shoe, when clicked
- add the option to start a new search on every step of the search (excluding the landing page, where it is superfluous and the recommendation view, where it is already in place)
- add headings for bullet points in shoe detail panel, and add a section (with heading) in the same panel, for common words used to review the shoe
- add placeholder description for recommendation view when mouse does not hover above a field
- let background color of recommendation panel blink when user hovers above a new recommendation
