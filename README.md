this is yalando. a new and innovative eCommerce platform where the user is precisely served the products he wants, based on his input.

this readme mostly tracks the stuff that still needs to be done/pushed:
- serve user only one completely random queue if the query does not contain useful information, instead of 3 separate queues based off separate starting points
- separate football shoes from all others -> if football is not searched explicitly, hide football shoes
- maybe animate more things
