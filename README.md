this is yalando. a new and innovative eCommerce platform where the user is precisely served the products he wants, based on his input.

this readme mostly tracks the stuff that still needs to be done/pushed:
- serve user only one completely random queue if the query does not contain usefull information, instead of 3 seperate queues based off seperate starting points
- add button to search for shoe id in wishlist, if it contains exactly one shoe
- automatically submit query if it contains id on load
- preview first shoe of wishlist if view is switched to wishlist, and wishlist contains at least one shoe
- show placeholder text in wishlist in preview panel if no shoe is in wishlist
- also show placeholder text in recommendation view in preview panel if queue is empty
- maybe animate more things
- separate football shoes from all others. if football is not searched explictely, hide football shoes
- show only best shoe as preview on embedding selection screen (no preselected preview)
